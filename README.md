In this case study, you’re provided data curated from different official reports to analyze the mass
destruction and fatalities in the region. You’re required to apply the concepts studied in the
course so far to:
1. Explore the dataset and identify the trends in fatalities over time. Identify any significant
changes, spikes, or declines in the number of fatalities.
2. Conduct an analysis by examining the age, gender, and citizenship of the individuals killed.
Determine if there are any notable patterns or disparities in the data.
3. Visualize the distribution of fatalities and identify areas that have experienced higher
levels of violence.
4. Examine the types of injuries inflicted on individuals. Identify the most common types of
injuries and assess their severity.
5. Analyze the ammunition and means by which the individuals were killed. Determine the
most frequently used weapons or methods and evaluate their impact.
6. Create profiles of the victims based on the available data such as age, gender, citizenship,
and place of residence. Identify common characteristics among the victims.
